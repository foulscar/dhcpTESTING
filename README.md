The purpose of this was for me to debug my Go [dhcp](https://github.com/foulscar/dhcp) package. I made this public because it might be useuful to others.


Within the podman folder is a script for building a container and bridges/interfaces for debugging dhcp client related tools. 

Within the client folder is a test client written in Go, using my [dhcp](https://github.com/foulscar/dhcp) package.
